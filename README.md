# More about me!
<hr>

<h4>Hola!👋 My name is Khush and I am a rising senior at James B Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. <strong>My passion is creating applications that benefit the world and solve problems for people.</h4>
  <br>
<h4> I mostly do android and web development, but I've developed many other applications using Java, C#, Javascript, and Python. These applications include games and apps that help society in any way possible. With these applications, I've learnt how to do UI/UX design, database implementation, Artifical Intelligence modeling and use, efficient debugging, and much more!</h4>
  <br>
<h4> In addition to coding, I love teaching others what I've learned and making my peers better developers. I do this by:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>📖Teaching and <a href="https://compscikids.net">getting kids interested in Computer Science</a></li>
  <li>🖥️Leading, teaching, and <a href="https://conant.hackclub.com">encouraging my peers to use new technology and software</a></li>
  <li>🏆Organizing and <a href="https://hackclub.com">planning mini hackathons with other Hack Club leaders for my peers and students</a></li>
</ul>
